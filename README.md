These are fast forward merges because the base branch being merged has had no new commits since the branch being commited has been edited, so it follows a straight line and "fast forwards" the new edits. 

One situation that would create a conflict would be changing the title on one branch, then changing the same title in another branch, then attempting to merge them. 

A situation that would NOT create conflict, is someone adding a header, and then another person adding a footer to the same html document. Because they are not editing the same element it will not create a conflict.
